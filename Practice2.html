<p>The advertisement in the New York Sun promised that the meeting would be highly
    entertaining. It was. Eighteen people who had taken the course were marshaled in
    front of the loudspeaker - and fifteen of them were given precisely seventy-five
    seconds each to tell his or her story. Only seventy-five seconds of talk, then “bang”
    went the gavel, and the chairman shouted, “Time! Next speaker!”
    The affair moved with the speed of a herd of buffalo thundering across the plains.
    Spectators stood for an hour and a half to watch the performance.
    The speakers were a cross section of life: several sales representatives, a chain store
    executive, a baker, the president of a trade association, two bankers, an insurance
    agent, an accountant, a dentist, an architect, a druggist who had come from
    Indianapolis to New York to take the course, a lawyer who had come from Havana
    in order to prepare himself to give one important three-minute speech.The advertisement in the New York Sun promised that the meeting would be highly
